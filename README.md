# FactorialExercise
Library for the calculation of basic and double factorials using iteration or recursion.

This is a simple C# implementation for calculating factorials and double factorials. The implementation consists of a class library, a unit test and an example console application.
The library makes it possible to calculate the factorials by using either iteration or recursion. This can be selected by setting a parameter when using the methods.
